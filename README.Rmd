The goal of {transfersh} is to utilize the power of [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) through R. \code{transfer.sh} is a website and not a script, which helps users to share files from the command-line an efficient way. It wonâ€™t required any additional software to work except pre-installed application such as curl. 

## Install

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kvasilopoulos/transfer")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use {transfersh}:

```{r load}
library(transfersh)
```

To upload a file you can easily use the name of the file and the path where the file is located, if it is not in the working directory. In case  of a folder or multiple files `tf_upload` will bundle all contents and zip it  into a single file. Then it will upload the zip and delete the zip that was created locally.

## File

```{r file}
tf_upload("file.txt", path = "inst/examples")
```

## Folder

```{r folder}
tf_upload("folder", path = "inst/examples")
```
